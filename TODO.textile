h1. TODOs / ideas for next releases

* document TransformationConfiguration annotation and put a page about inheritance in the docs
* document merge() instance method
* implement "sparse index definitions":http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Indexes#Indexes-SparseIndexes for MongoDB 1.8
* figure out some tests for inheritance scenarios
* add a refresh method to instances, to pull current data from db again
* remove deprecated stuff
* use "GMongo":http://blog.paulopoiati.com/2010/06/20/gmongo-0-5-released/ as driver wrapper (optional, can be turned of in configuration. morphia will still use the undecorated mongo-driver)
* check out "GORM Redis":http://grails.org/plugin/redis plugin and the "inconsequential":http://github.com/grails/inconsequential implementation and derive some best practices
* add WriteConcern to methods, where applicable
* add option to drop database on startup (dbCreate = "create-drop" // one of 'create', 'create-drop','update' see http://grails.org/doc/1.3.x/guide/3.%20Configuration.html#3.3%20The%20DataSource)
* map Datastore methods onto Domain classes (as static and instance methods) - updateFirst, findAndUpdate
* Add test for index definition syntax
* save method: add support for failOnError:true in grails 1.2 (GRAILS-4343)
* implement GridFS access
* -process belongsTo and hasMany properties (via AST)
